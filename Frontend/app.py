# laparoscopic hernia repair on 03/22/2024 for a right inguinal hernia. The surgery, led by Dr. Anil
# Kumar and anesthesiologist Dr. Rhea Desai, lasted 1 hour and 30 minutes and involved three small
# abdominal incisions and mesh repair, concluding without complications. Patel's medical history
# includes controlled hypertension without prior surgeries. Post-surgery, Patel stayed in recovery
# for 2 hours with stable vitals, and received instructions for pain management, activity restrictions,
# and a follow-up on 04/05/2024. Discharge on 03/23/2024 included guidelines for pain
# management, wound care, infection monitoring, and a scheduled follow-up with Dr. Kumar.

# Patient John Doe, a 45-year-old male, was admitted for elective surgical repair of bilateral inguinal hernias, which he reported having troubled him for the past six months. The discomfort was notably exacerbated by physical activities and lifting heavy objects. On physical examination, the hernias were observed as bilateral, reducible, and without signs of strangulation or obstruction.
# The decision to perform a Transabdominal Preperitoneal (TEPP) hernia repair was made given the patient‚Äôs symptoms and physical findings. The procedure commenced at 08:30 AM under general anesthesia. The approach involved making a small incision just above the pubic area, followed by the insertion of a laparoscope for visualization. The hernia sacs were carefully dissected and reduced back into the abdominal cavity. A mesh was placed over the peritoneal opening to reinforce the abdominal wall and prevent recurrence.
# The mesh was secured without complications, and the layers of the abdomen were meticulously closed. The operation concluded successfully at 11:15 AM. Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition. He was monitored for any immediate complications and was prescribed pain management and instructions to limit physical activity. Follow-up was scheduled for two weeks post-operation to assess healing and discuss gradual return to normal activities. The patient was educated on signs of potential complications, such as infection or recurrence, and advised to report any unusual symptoms promptly.
